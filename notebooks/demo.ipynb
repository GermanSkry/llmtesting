       "('A horror with romance book, what a great combination! I\\'d be happy to suggest some books that fit your request.\\n\\nConsidering you\\'re looking for a blend of horror and romance, here are a few suggestions:\\n\\n1. **Lover Mine (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #8)** by J.R. Ward - This paranormal romance novel combines vampire lore with a dark and suspenseful plot, perfect for fans of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.\\n2. **Steal Away** by Amber Green - This African-American Prohibition-era Historical Ménage has elements of horror, mystery, and romance, set against the vibrant backdrop of 1920s Harlem.\\n3. **Desperation** by Stephen King - While not strictly a romance novel, Desperation features a strong romantic subplot amidst its dark and supernatural horror themes.\\n4. **The Good Soldier** by Ford Madox Ford - This classic novel explores complex social relationships, passion, and intrigue, with some elements of psychological horror.\\n\\nHowever, I must say that none of these books seem to have the \"horror\" element as a primary focus. If you\\'re looking for something more explicitly horror-oriented with romantic undertones, you might want to consider:\\n\\n1. **Masquerade** by Jez Jones (mentioned in your context) - This Victorian steampunk romance novel features sensual and erotic elements amidst its darker themes.\\n2. **Pulp** by Charles Bukowski - While not traditionally a \"romance\" novel, Pulp has some darkly comedic and romantic undertones amidst its seedy Los Angeles setting.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that the line between horror and romance can be blurry, and individual tastes may vary. If you have any specific preferences (e.g., paranormal romance, historical horror), I\\'d be happy to provide more tailored suggestions!',\n",

This is the story of Martha's courageous defiance and ultimate death, as told by the daughter who survived.Kathleen Kent is a tenth generation descendant of Martha Carrier.
